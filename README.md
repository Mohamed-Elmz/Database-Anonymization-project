# Database-Anonymization-project

In this project, I aim to de-identify and analyze census data that presents many potential privacy risks. Census statistics are reported at the block level wich means that Releasing *data* that is useful makes ensuring *privacy* very difficult. However, with the use of principles such as generalization and suppression, I will produce a dataset that balances utility and security.
